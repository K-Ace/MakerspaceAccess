Utilizing an RFID reader to see who comes in and out of the space.

Useful Notes:
The reader just types in a number from a tag. It acts as a keyboard so if we can capture keyboard input we can use it. I don't want to use the standard input() because that means the script would have to be run locally rather than headless over ssh for example.

So this may come in handy: [RFID reading in python](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/inputexec)
